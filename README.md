🫀 Heart Attack Prediction (ML + AutoML)
🔍 Overview
This project predicts the risk of a heart attack using both traditional machine learning models and H2O AutoML. It aims to assist in early diagnosis based on clinical data like age, cholesterol, chest pain, etc.

📊 Dataset: heart.csv

💻 Code: Notebook

🧰 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (ML Models)

H2O AutoML

Google Colab

📈 Models Used
Type	Models
Traditional ML	Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
AutoML	H2O (GBM, XGBoost, Ensemble, etc.)

🔥 Best Model: H2O Stacked Ensemble

🎯 Accuracy: ~87% | AUC: 0.92

💡 Key Insights
Features like age, cholesterol, chest pain type are strong indicators.

AutoML simplifies model selection and tuning.

Traditional models also performed well with proper tuning.

🚀 How to Use
Open the notebook in Google Colab

Run all cells

AutoML block will generate a leaderboard of best models

✨ Future Work
Streamlit app for live prediction

Model deployment on Heroku or AWS

Larger dataset for more generalization
