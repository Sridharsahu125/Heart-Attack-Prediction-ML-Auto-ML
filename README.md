🫀 Heart Attack Prediction (ML + AutoML)


🔍 Overview
This project predicts the risk of a heart attack using both traditional machine learning models and H2O AutoML. It helps in early diagnosis using clinical features like age, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.

Code: https://github.com/Sridharsahu125/Heart-Attack-Prediction-ML-Auto-ML/blob/main/Heart_attact_Prediction.ipynb



🧰 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (ML models)

H2O AutoML

Google Colab



📈 Models Used
Type	Models
Traditional ML	Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
AutoML	H2O AutoML (GBM, XGBoost, Ensemble, etc.)

Best Model: H2O Stacked Ensemble

Accuracy: ~87%

AUC Score: 0.92



💡 Key Insights
Important features: age, cholesterol, chest pain type

AutoML saves time by selecting and tuning the best model

Traditional models also gave good performance with proper tuning



🚀 How to Use
Download the notebook file and dataset

Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

Run all cells and check the AutoML leaderboard for best results



✨ Future Work
Build a Streamlit or Flask app for predictions

Deploy model on cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS)

Use more data for improved model accuracy
